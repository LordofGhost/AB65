## The process

### Why I built it?

- I have always wondered what exactly happens in a computer, when I started writing my first programs with java it didn't really answer my questions but rather raised more questions. Then one day a video of Ben Eater was suggested to me and I was immediately enthusiastic about the idea of building a computer myself.

### Building

- So that I don't lose track of the cables, I opened the [schematics](https://eater.net/schematics/6502-serial.png) on my Ipad and marked each completed connection in green. 
- Thanks to Ben Eater's videos, I was able to understand what the individual components do during construction.

### Problems

- Get all the parts you need for your computer without spending a to much money
- Poor power supply to some parts

### Problem fixing 

- Power connection on every breadboard

### Functions

- reading and display inputs of a PS2 Keyboard
- interact with a other computer by RS232

## Conclusion

- It was a very instructive project in terms of my understanding of computers and electronics in general. 

## Future plans

- create my own little os for the computer
- self-built gpu for the computer to be able to use it on a monitor
