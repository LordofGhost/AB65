## The process

### Why I built it?

- I have always wondered what exactly happens in a computer, when I started writing my first programs with java it didn't really answer my questions but rather raised more questions. Then one day a video of Ben Eater was suggested to me and I was immediately enthusiastic about the idea of building a computer myself.

### Problems

### Problem fixing 

## Conclusion

## Future plans

- create my own little os
- self-built gpu for the computer to be able to use it on a monitor

All the stuff shown in this repository was created by [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/beneater) and I was in no way involved in the development.
